Short Paragraph:
Service workers are related to graceful degradation because service workers are 
responsible for helping make sure your webpage is able to run offline if the 
network becomes unavaliable. Graceful degradation is the concept of a website
still being usable even being disconnected from the network. Service Workers
use a cache to ensure that the different requests made by your webapp are still
fulfilled even offline.
